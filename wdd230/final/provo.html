            <p>Provo is your place to have fun outdoors, it has Provo Canyon and river and it also borders Utah Lake.  The Sundance Resort in the Canyon is a wonderful place for both Winter and Summer sports.  Provo is home of a major University BYU-Provo, major attractions related to the University are sporting events as well as many museuems and performances.  Provo is the home of the Freedom Festival which is a celebration centered around the Fourth of July.  Because many people that live in Provo have lived overseas you will find many delicious food options from all over the world.

              <p>Just an hour south of Salt Lake City on Interstate 15 there is a section of the state called Utah Valley. Although the Ute Indians anciently inhabited this area, today the valley is home to Provo, Utah's third largest city. To the west of Provo lies Utah Lake, and to the east of the city stand a towering range of mountains called the Wasatch Front. The history of Provo is an interesting page in the history of the Beehive State. Visitors who come to Provo will find several historic sites. These historic sites are cultural resources worthy of preservation as landmarks of the community.
