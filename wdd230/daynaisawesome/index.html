            The navigation has lots of white space and in the body the image has white space and then the Brand name is shown in bold and a description of the brand followed by a link.  All elements have whitespace so users can easily identify the different sections.

            The repetition is used to show previous packs.  All packs have sold out and the styling is the same however you can see the differences between the packs even when the styling is the same.  You can see things like the series, type and even the number of packs sold are all shown so the content can be different but the style is always the same to tell you it's a previous pack.

            You have to scroll down a little bit to see this section.  This alignment is different than what I normally see on a mobile browser.  The images are smaller and on the left and the associated headline and author are on the right.
